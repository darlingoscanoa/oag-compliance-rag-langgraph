        CRITICAL: You MUST output the FULL DETAILED REPORT in your final response. Do not just say "analysis complete".
        
        Instructions:
        1. Retrieve relevant regulatory clauses from SOR/2018-66 (federal methane regulations) and AER Directive 060 (Alberta flaring/venting).
        2. Compare document against regulations and identify gaps with:
           - Specific regulation citation (e.g., "SOR/2018-66, Section 8(1)")
           - Severity (Low/Medium/High)
           - Brief rationale
        3. If NO significant gaps: provide SHORT compliance checklist (3-5 categories with ‚úÖ).
        4. If gaps found: YOU MUST provide the COMPLETE detailed report with:
           - Executive summary paragraph
           - Each gap listed with:
             * Gap title
             * Regulation citation
             * Severity level
             * Detailed rationale
           - 2-3 recommended corrective actions
        
        Document excerpt (first 2000 chars):
        {full_text[:2000]}
        
        EXAMPLE FORMAT FOR COMPLIANT DOCUMENTS:
        **Compliance Status: COMPLIANT ‚úÖ**
        
        - ‚úÖ LDAR Program: Quarterly surveys completed (SOR/2018-66, Section 6)
        - ‚úÖ Pneumatic Devices: All low-bleed or instrument air (SOR/2018-66, Section 8)
        - ‚úÖ Venting/Flaring: VRU installed, <100 m¬≥/month (AER Directive 060)
        - ‚úÖ Water Management: Closed-loop system, licensed disposal (AER Directive 086)
        - ‚úÖ Documentation: Current ERP, trained staff
        
        **Conclusion**: Operations meet regulatory requirements. Continue current practices.

        **Executive Summary**
        Site B demonstrates multiple high-severity compliance gaps requiring immediate corrective action. Key violations include overdue LDAR surveys, prohibited high-bleed pneumatic devices, and excessive venting without flare routing.
        
        **Identified Compliance Gaps:**
        
        1. **Gap**: LDAR Survey Frequency Non-Compliance
           **Regulation**: SOR/2018-66, Section 6 - Requires quarterly (3-month) LDAR surveys
           **Severity**: HIGH
           **Rationale**: Last survey completed October 2023 (18 months ago). Facility is 15 months overdue for required quarterly inspections, risking undetected fugitive methane emissions.
        
        2. **Gap**: Prohibited High-Bleed Pneumatic Devices
           **Regulation**: SOR/2018-66, Section 8(1) - Prohibits high-bleed devices (>6 scf/hr) after January 1, 2023
           **Severity**: HIGH
           **Rationale**: 12 high-bleed pneumatic controllers currently in operation (4 separator controls, 6 tank level controls, 2 compressor controls). All must be replaced with low-bleed (<6 scf/hr) or instrument air systems.
        
        3. **Gap**: Excessive Venting Without Flare Routing
           **Regulation**: AER Directive 060, Section 3.2 - Requires flare routing for venting >500 m¬≥/month
           **Severity**: HIGH
           **Rationale**: Facility vents 1,200 m¬≥/month directly to atmosphere (2.4x the threshold). No flare system installed. Immediate flare installation or vapor recovery required.
        
        4. **Gap**: Unauthorized Water Discharge
           **Regulation**: AER Directive 086 - Requires immediate notification of produced water releases
           **Severity**: MEDIUM
           **Rationale**: 15 m¬≥ produced water overflow on Sept 10. Verbal notification only, formal AER notification not submitted within required timeframe.
        
        **Recommended Corrective Actions:**
        1. **Immediate**: Schedule comprehensive LDAR survey within 30 days and establish quarterly survey calendar
        2. **Priority**: Replace all 12 high-bleed pneumatic devices with compliant low-bleed or instrument air systems by Q1 2026
        3. **Critical**: Install flare system or vapor recovery unit to eliminate atmospheric venting, target completion Q2 2026
